# libretrocore

**libretocore** is a libretro core.

## Features


## Building

To build **libretrocore**, you must have [CMake](https://cmake.org) and a build system of your choice.

1. Download the repository.
2. Create a `build` folder there.
3. Move into the `build` folder.
4. Run `cmake .. -G "Ninja"` (CMake supports many different build systems; [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org) is just one of them).
5. When finished, move back to the repository root.
6. Run `cmake --build build`.
7. When finished, you will find `libretrocore.dll` or `libretrocore.so` in the `bin` folder.

## Running

Run the RetroArch executable with the following command, specifying the path to the **libretrocore** library after building, along with the game file:

```
retroarch -L path/to/libretrocore.so path/to/game_file
```

For example, if you are on a GNU/Linux system and located in the repository root, you can run:

```
retroarch -L build/libretrocore.so build/snake.cart
```
